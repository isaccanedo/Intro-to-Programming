#Take the following array:

a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']
     
#and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. 
#(ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.

arr = []

a.each do |phrase|
  arr << phrase.split(" ")
end
arr.flatten!

print arr
